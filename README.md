**Chordster**
Chordster is an Android application that makes it easy for guitarists to find songs they can play with the chords they know. By selecting a set of chords, the app provides a list of songs that can be played using only those chords.

The app features a database of songs with their corresponding chords and chord sheets. The chord sheets are displayed in image form with chords inline with the lyrics for easy readability.

**Song Chord Sheets:** After finding a song they want to play, guitarists can view the song's chord sheet, which displays the song lyrics with the chords inline.
